# Interactive Digit Recognition

Implementation of SVM on the MNIST database: interactive digit drawing and recognition + viewing some MNIST instances visually. Some comments:
- The script ["main.py"]() needs the databases on the execution path file. Since databases can't be uploaded to GitHub, i've uploaded them to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gO1JQnIuk_lpRx5cP9Gho-lCodyaPakz?usp=sharing)
- In order to avoid large execution times, i've already trained a model for the MNIST database. The model too needs to be on the execution path file (along with the scripts). U can download the model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13OXYSQ6K5MJ3fEXjDBzMSZ9RcwJ8jtKn?usp=sharing)
